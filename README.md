# An-emergent-model-of-organic-matter-decomposition-by-soil-enzymes.
**This depository deposits source data and code supporting our model-based analysis of an  emergent model of soil enzyme-driven organic matter decomposition**

In detail, this repository stores data & code following the order of figures occurring in our manuscript(by Wang and Allison).For each figure (six in total, of which 2 are supporting figures), the source data and the corresponding code doing the statistical analysis (in R) and drawing plots (in Python 3.6) in a format of Jupyter Notebook are deposited.

With JupyterNotebook, step-by-step analyses are demonstrated, facilicating reproducible analysis.

Any questions should be directed to B. Wang at wbwenwu@gmail.com or bw8my@virginia.edu
