These are the 'Source' data directly from the model outputs of DEMENT(version xxxx), from which data for next-step analyses are generated,
as listed in the other folders labelled with Figure_x. In terms of how-to-generate,code in Jupyter Notebook is provided. Each file and 
the corresponding model setup generating the data in each file is listed in the Jupyternotebook.
